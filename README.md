Hi there my name is Krystle Capuano welcome my book website!!! My idea here was to create something similar to Good Reads, but for personal use. It's an online book record to organize books you've read, books to read, and even save your favorite quotes. All three pages have a libraries and must have tabs. My goal is to later add a page to search for library closest to you and another page for book accessories. The main page is includes a discussion board to ..............., In the menu drop down bar you will find an example of what someones library might look like and the second is examples of pinned quotes and a filter option by genres and authors.
Used Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flexbox; and Chat GPT helped me think of a book site name.
